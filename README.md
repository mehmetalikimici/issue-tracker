# Issue Tracker

I created an issue tracker site. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS and Bootstrap.<br>

As seen in the design, I created a issue tracker where we can add topics according to their priorities and for different people.
After the issues were added, I created the dynamics with JavaScript and added closing and deleting the topics after they were completed to my project.
